       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p><em>Lasagna</em> is a classic <strong>Italian</strong> dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich sauces and fillings like seasoned ground meat, tomato sauce, béchamel (white sauce), and cheese—usually mozzarella and parmesan. It's baked in the oven until the layers meld into a flavorful, hearty casserole with a bubbling, golden top.</p>
       <p>
        Traditionally served as a main course, <em>lasagna</em> is known for its comforting taste and satisfying texture. Variations exist across regions and diets—such as vegetarian versions with spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini. It's a popular dish for gatherings, as it can be prepared in advance and served in generous portions.
